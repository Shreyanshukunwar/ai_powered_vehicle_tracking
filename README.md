# AI Powered Vehicle Tracking
<hr>
A web-based application to find vehicles based on their number plate using ML in python.

## Background
As part of the Final year Major Project, we created an application that can be used to identify the number plates of vehicles (four-wheelers), and pin-point their location based on the the coordinates found.

### Tools Used
<hr>
1. Python
2. Django Framework
3. MySQL

### APIs Implemented
1. Mapbox
2. Mailgun

## AI Portion
In order to localize the plates and identify the characeters, techniques such as the Sobel Edge Detection and CNN was used.
All of this was implemented using various python packages which can be found in **requirementsAI.txt**

**To install all the required packages**
```
pip install -r requirements_all.txt
```
